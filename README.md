## Docker with .NET Core Tutorials



#### Prerequisites

These tutorials assumes you have Windows 10 Pro and [.NET core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows) installed. The professional edition is mandatory as we'll be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) for container deployment. Given the .NET core framework evolves quickly, it's worth noting these tutorials are written and tested against .NET core 2.1 (your results may vary).
